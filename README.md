### About me
Therefore, my professional goal is to enter the IT industry and develop as a Junior Software Tester. I gained the necessary knowledge in this field during 115 hours of the practical "Software Tester" course at SDA.
What I like about testing is that I have the opportunity to test something as one of the first people, and that I have an impact on improving a given program or application. I like new solutions.
My advantage is the ability to effectively plan working time, and the knowledge related to documenting and reporting test results.
I devote my free time to self-education in the field of tests, databases and the basics of programming.
I will be happy to join the team that I will be able to support with my skills.
